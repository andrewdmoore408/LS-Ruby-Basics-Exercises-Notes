Methods have an implicit return, which is the returned value of the last line executed

If a value is returned but not stored in a variable (or mutating a preexisting variable), it will be inaccessible.

Reassignment (including operators like += and -=) do not mutate a variable--they set a variable to point to a different object.

Strings are mutable--note that String#[]= (changing a character) DOES mutate the original string.

Local variables inside method definitions are their own set--local variables declared inside methods can't be accessed outside them, and outside local variable aren't visible inside method definitions.

Unlike method definitions, invoking a method using a block can access previously declared local variables.
